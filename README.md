## 🔐 API Credentials Setup & Security

This application uses the free [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/) service to fetch live weather data.

### How to Obtain an API Key

1. Go to [https://www.weatherapi.com](https://www.weatherapi.com)
2. Create a free account.
3. After signing in, navigate to your Dashboard.
4. Copy the free API key listed there.

### How This App Handles Your Key Securely

- The app **does not store or expose your API key in the source code**.
- When you first use the app, it will **prompt you to enter your API key**.
- The key is temporarily saved in your browser using **sessionStorage** — this means:
  - It stays available during the session (while the tab is open)
  - It is automatically cleared when the tab is closed or reloaded
- You can manually reset the key using the “Reset API Key” button

This approach ensures your key remains secure and complies with the assignment’s credential and security requirements.
